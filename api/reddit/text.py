POST_TEXT = """
Hello, fellow Redditors!

This is a bot dedicated to helping refugees in need connect with vital funding, grants, and job opportunities. We aim to bridge the gap between refugees seeking assistance and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) or philanthropic initiatives that can provide support.

**For NGOs and Organizations:**
If your organization offers grants, funding, or job placements specifically for refugees, please consider sharing these opportunities publicly. You can:
* Post directly in relevant subreddits (e.g., `r/humanitarian`, `r/grants`, `r/jobs`)
* Provide a link to your organization's "opportunities" or "support" page in the comments.
* Reach out to us via DM if you have a program you'd like to highlight (we can't guarantee widespread promotion, but we're here to help connect).

**For Refugees and Supporters:**
We understand the immense challenges faced by refugees. While this bot cannot directly provide aid, it serves as a platform to highlight available resources. Please keep an eye on discussions and shared links.

Our goal is to facilitate connections and amplify efforts to support those who need it most.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
